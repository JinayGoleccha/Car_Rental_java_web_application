The Car Rental System is a web-based Java project designed to automate the process of 
renting vehicles online. It is developed using key Java technologies such as Java Server 
Pages (JSP), Servlets, and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). The project is built and 
managed in Eclipse IDE and deployed on the Apache Tomcat 11 server. 
The backend logic is handled through Java Servlets, which manage user requests such 
as login authentication, car browsing, and booking operations. JSP pages are used for 
dynamically generating content on the frontend, making the user interface interactive 
and connected with the server-side logic. JDBC is used to establish a secure connection 
between the Java application and the MySQL database, ensuring reliable data storage 
and retrieval of user details, car information, and booking records. 
The system enables users to register, log in, view available cars, and make bookings 
through a simple web interface. It follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
architecture, where Servlets act as controllers, JSPs as the view, and Java classes as the 
model. This separation of concerns improves maintainability and scalability of the 
application. 
The main objective of this project is to provide an efficient, digital platform for car 
rental companies and customers, minimizing manual effort and errors. It showcases the 
practical use of enterprise-level Java technologies in developing real-world applications.
